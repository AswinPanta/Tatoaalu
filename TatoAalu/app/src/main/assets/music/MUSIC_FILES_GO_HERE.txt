# Hot Potato Music Files

This directory should contain your music files for the Hot Potato game.

## How to Add Music:

1. Copy your music files to this directory
2. Rename them to: song1.mp3, song2.mp3, song3.mp3, etc.
3. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A

## Example files to add:
- song1.mp3
- song2.mp3
- song3.mp3
- song4.mp3
- song5.mp3

## Requirements:
- Files should be 30 seconds to 2 minutes long
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB each)
- Use consistent volume levels across all files
- Upbeat, party-style music works best

## Free Music Sources:
- YouTube Audio Library
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat (free tier)
- Local music (ensure you have rights to use)

## Note:
If no music files are present, the game will use a timer-based fallback system that still provides the same random 10-30 second gameplay timing without actual music playback.

The game will automatically detect and use any properly named music files in this directory.
